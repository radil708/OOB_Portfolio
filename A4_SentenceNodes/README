Features:
	- Interface (Super/Sub type relationship) implementation
	- Implemented node and recursive data structure
	- JUnit Testing
==========================================================================================
High Level Requirements:
	- Create a recursive structure that represents a sentence
	- Each node in the recursive structure should represent a word or punctuation
		and the structure must end with an EmptyNode
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define the following operations for such a list of words:

	A method getNumberOfWords that computes and returns the number of words in a sentence. 
		The punctuation does not count as a word. This method should answer/return an int.

	A method longestWord that determines and returns the longest word in a sentence. The word 
		returned is just the word, and should not begin or end with punctuation. If the 
		sentence contains no words, longestWord should return an empty string.
		This method should answer/return a String

	A method toString that will convert the sentence into one string. There must be a space 
		between every two words. A punctuation mark should have no space between it and 
		whatever precedes it. There is no space between the last word and the end of this
		 sentence. If there is no punctuation mark at the end of the sentence, this string 
		should end with a period (this method should NOT add a period to the original sentence
		 object, but the String answered by this method should properly have the period)
		This method should answer/return a String

	A method clone() that returns a duplicate of a given sentence. A duplicate is a list that
		 has the same words and punctuation in the same sequence, but is independent of the original list.
		This method should answer/return a Sentence

	A method merge(Sentence other) that will merge two sentences into a single sentence. 
		The merged list should preserve all the punctuation. The merged list should be
		returned by this method, and the original lists should be unchanged.
		This method should answer/return a Sentence

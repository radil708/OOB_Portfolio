You can run this code and play TicTacToe by using the command:
	java.exe -jar MVCTicTacToe.jar

Note: your java.exe may be present in a different folder so 
	make sure to include the full filepath to java.exe for ex.	
	my java.exe is in the folder C:\Users\me\.jdks\openjdk-16\bin\java.exe
	so I would use the command:
	
	C:\Users\me\.jdks\openjdk-16\bin\java.exe -jar MVCTicTacToe.jar
